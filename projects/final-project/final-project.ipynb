    "In real-world studies, getting a truly representative random sample of the population is often incredibly difficult. Even just to accurately represent all Americans, a truly random sample would need to examine people across geographical, socioeconomic, community, and class lines (just to name a few). For a study like this, scientists would also need to make sure the medical exams were standardized and consistent across the different people being examined. In other words, there's a tradeoff between taking a more representative random sample and the cost of collecting more information from each person in the sample.\n",

The Framingham study is generally considered the best in its class, so we'll continue working with it while keeping its limitations in mind.\n",

It began in 1976 by Dr. Frank Speizer, with questionnaires that were mailed to 121,964 female registered nurses in the United States asking about their medical history, cholesterol and blood pressure, current medications, and so on (one of the benefits of studying nurses is their ability to give reliably accurate answers to these questions). \n",

The NHS continues to this day, tracking its third generation of nurses in the US.\n",

In a landmark 1985 paper in the *New England Journal of Medicine* (NEJM), Speizer and his coauthors wrote that\n",

These data support the hypothesis that the postmenopausal use of estrogen reduces the risk of severe coronary heart disease. [(Stampfer et al., 1985)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4047106)\n",
